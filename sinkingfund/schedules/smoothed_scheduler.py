Smoothing Scheduler
===================

This module provides a smoothed scheduler that schedules payments
across multiple envelopes, optimizing for payment smoothing and
opportunity cost.

Multi-Envelope Smoothing
========================
* Calculates total funds needed across all envelopes.
* Determines ideal contribution rate based on time available.
* Allocates this rate proportionally to envelopes.
* Ensures even cash outflow over time.
* Makes budgeting more predictable.

Opportunity Cost Optimization
=============================
* Keeps money in interest-bearing accounts as long as possible.
* Uses backloaded payment schedules (smaller earlier, larger later).
* Calculates optimal payment timing based on interest rates.
* Maximizes interest earned while still meeting obligations.
* More sophisticated approach to value of money over time.

Benefits of This Design
=======================
* Strategy Pattern: Easy to switch between different scheduling
approaches.
* Financial Optimization: Both approaches optimize a specific financial
metric.
* Advanced Scheduling: More sophisticated than simple equal payments.
* Customizable: Parameters can be adjusted (interest rate, smoothness
factor).
* Clean Architecture: Separates scheduling logic from envelope data.

The key insight in both approaches is treating payment scheduling as a
global optimization problem rather than individual envelope
calculations. This allows for more sophisticated financial strategies
while maintaining
a clean architecture.

        Schedule contributions for all envelopes that minimize the
        variance in total contributions per interval. If a user has
        multiple envelopes, this will allocate contributions to each
        envelope such that the total contribution per interval is
        as smooth as possible.

        The contribution interval is user-driven, but will be the same
        for all envelopes.
