"""
Scheduler Base Module
=====================

This module establishes the foundation for all cash flow scheduling
strategies in the sinking fund system through a consistent abstract
interface.

Scheduling is the process of determining when money should flow into and
out of envelopes over time. This module provides the framework for
implementing various scheduling strategies through:

#. Abstract Interface Definition: The BaseScheduler abstract class
defines the contract that all scheduling strategies must follow.
#. Strategy Pattern Implementation: Enables multiple interchangeable
scheduling algorithms that can be selected at runtime.
#. Consistent API: Ensures all scheduling strategies support the same
core operations with consistent parameters.

The scheduling process determines:
* When contributions should be made to each envelope.
* How contributions are timed relative to bill due dates.
* The pattern and frequency of cash flows.
* How to handle irregular payment cycles.

By implementing the BaseScheduler interface, specialized scheduling
strategies can implement approaches like:
* Equal periodic contributions leading up to a bill's due date.
* Front-loaded contributions to build buffer early.
* Just-in-time contribution schedules.
* Income-synchronized contribution timing.
* Dynamic scheduling based on changing circumstances.

Schedulers transform allocation plans into actionable timelines,
creating the cash flow roadmap needed to successfully fund future
expenses through your sinking fund system.
