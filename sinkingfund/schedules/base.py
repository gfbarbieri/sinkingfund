Scheduler Base Module
=====================

This module establishes the foundation for all cash flow scheduling
strategies in the sinking fund system through a consistent abstract
interface.

Scheduling is the process of determining when money should flow into and
out of envelopes over time. This module provides the framework for
implementing various scheduling strategies through:

#. Abstract Interface Definition: The BaseScheduler abstract class
defines the contract that all scheduling strategies must follow.
#. Strategy Pattern Implementation: Enables multiple interchangeable
scheduling algorithms that can be selected at runtime.
#. Consistent API: Ensures all scheduling strategies support the same
core operations with consistent parameters.

The scheduling process determines:
* When contributions should be made to each envelope.
* How contributions are timed relative to bill due dates.
* The pattern and frequency of cash flows.
* How to handle irregular payment cycles.

By implementing the BaseScheduler interface, specialized scheduling
strategies can implement approaches like:
* Equal periodic contributions leading up to a bill's due date.
* Front-loaded contributions to build buffer early.
* Just-in-time contribution schedules.
* Income-synchronized contribution timing.
* Dynamic scheduling based on changing circumstances.

Schedulers transform allocation plans into actionable timelines,
creating the cash flow roadmap needed to successfully fund future
expenses through your sinking fund system.

class BaseScheduler(ABC):
    """
    Abstract foundation for implementing cash flow scheduling strategies
    in sinking fund management.
    
    The BaseScheduler defines the essential contract that all scheduling
    algorithms must implement, ensuring consistent behavior across
    different optimization approaches while allowing for specialized
    implementation strategies.
    
    Core Responsibilities
    --------------------
    
    All scheduler implementations must handle:
    
    #. **Timing Optimization**: Determine when contributions should be
       made to achieve funding goals by bill due dates.
       
    #. **Cash Flow Generation**: Create the specific sequence of
       monetary transactions (contributions and payments) for each
       envelope.
       
    #. **Schedule Integration**: Apply generated schedules to envelopes
       in a way that integrates with the broader sinking fund workflow.
    
    Design Patterns
    ---------------
    
    This abstract base implements the Strategy pattern, enabling:
    
    * **Runtime Algorithm Selection**: Different scheduling approaches
      can be chosen based on user preferences or optimization criteria.
      
    * **Extensibility**: New scheduling algorithms can be added without
      modifying existing code by implementing this interface.
      
    * **Testability**: Each scheduling strategy can be tested in
      isolation while maintaining interface compatibility.
    
    Implementation Guidelines
    ------------------------
    
    Concrete schedulers should:
    
    * Validate envelope inputs and handle edge cases gracefully
    * Generate cash flows that exactly fund bill amounts by due dates
    * Handle rounding errors in financial calculations appropriately
    * Respect envelope-specific contribution intervals and preferences
    * Modify envelopes in-place by setting their schedule attributes
    
    Example Implementation Structure
    -------------------------------
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
       class CustomScheduler(BaseScheduler):
           def schedule(self, envelopes: list[Envelope]) -> None:
               for envelope in envelopes:
                   # Generate cash flows for this envelope
                   cash_flows = self._create_cash_flows(envelope)
                   
                   # Apply schedule to envelope
                   envelope.schedule = CashFlowSchedule(cash_flows)
    
    Notes
    -----
    
    Schedulers modify envelopes in-place rather than returning new
    objects. This design choice maintains object relationships and
    optimizes memory usage, but requires careful handling in concurrent
    scenarios.
    """
    
    @abstractmethod
    def schedule(self, envelopes: list[Envelope], **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Create and apply contribution schedules to the provided envelopes
        using the implemented scheduling strategy.
        
        This method represents the core scheduling operation that all
        concrete scheduler implementations must provide. It should
        generate appropriate cash flow schedules and apply them directly
        to the envelopes.
        
        Implementation Requirements
        --------------------------
        
        Concrete implementations must:
        
        #. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure envelopes have valid bill
           instances and required configuration.
           
        #. **Generate Cash Flows**: Create contribution and payment cash
           flows that exactly fund each bill by its due date.
           
        #. **Handle Edge Cases**: Gracefully manage scenarios like
           past-due bills, zero amounts, or invalid intervals.
           
        #. **Apply Schedules**: Set the schedule attribute on each
           envelope with the generated cash flows.
           
        #. **Maintain Precision**: Use appropriate rounding and handle
           financial precision requirements correctly.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        envelopes : list[Envelope]
            The envelopes for which to create contribution schedules.
            Each envelope should have a valid bill instance and
            contribution parameters defined. Empty lists are handled
            gracefully.
            
        **kwargs
            Strategy-specific parameters that may include:
            
            * Optimization preferences (smoothness vs. simplicity)
            * Timing constraints or preferences
            * Risk tolerance settings
            * External factor considerations
            
        Returns
        -------
        None
            Schedules are applied directly to envelopes by setting their
            schedule attribute. This in-place modification maintains
            object relationships and optimizes memory usage.
            
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If envelopes have invalid configuration or incompatible
            parameters that prevent schedule generation.
            
        Notes
        -----
        
        * **Side Effects**: This method modifies the provided envelopes
          in-place by setting their schedule attributes.
          
        * **Idempotency**: Multiple calls with the same parameters
          should produce equivalent results.
          
        * **Performance**: Implementations should handle large envelope
          lists efficiently and avoid unnecessary computations.
          
        * **Financial Precision**: All monetary calculations should use
          appropriate precision (typically Decimal with cent-level
          quantization) to avoid floating-point errors.
