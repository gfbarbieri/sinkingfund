    "# Loading and Analyzing Bills\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to load financial obligations from a CSV file into bill objects for a sinking fund system. Bills are the foundation of any sinking fund - they represent the future expenses you're planning for, whether one-time payments or recurring obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loader utility makes it easy to import bill information from a spreadsheet instead of manually creating each bill object. This is particularly helpful when setting up a sinking fund with numerous expenses or when updating your financial plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts to understand:\n",
    "- One-time bills have a specific due_date.\n",
    "- Recurring bills have a start_date, frequency, and interval.\n",
    "- Bills are independent of contribution strategies (which are handled by envelopes).\n",
    "- The bill model supports various recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)."
