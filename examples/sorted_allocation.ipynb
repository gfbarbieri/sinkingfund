    "# Example: Sorted Allocation of Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to allocate an existing balance across multiple financial obligations in a sinking fund system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Allocate Existing Balances?\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, you'll often start with an existing balance in your sinking fund rather than from zero. This happens in several common situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transitioning from an unstructured to structured approach**: You may have been saving for future expenses without a formal system, and now want to organize those funds into specific envelopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Windfall allocation**: Perhaps you received a tax refund, bonus, or gift that you want to distribute across multiple future expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Account consolidation**: You might be combining multiple savings accounts into a single sinking fund system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rebalancing existing allocations**: As financial priorities shift, you may need to reallocate your existing sinking fund balance to better align with your current needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Starting mid-way through a financial year**: Many expenses (like property taxes, insurance premiums) operate on annual cycles, and you may be implementing your sinking fund system in the middle of these cycles with partially saved amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Allocation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a lump sum to allocate across multiple future expenses, you need a systematic approach to determine which expenses should receive funding priority. The allocation strategies demonstrated in this notebook address this challenge by providing different methods to prioritize your expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each strategy offers different advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cascade (due-date priority)**: Ensures your most imminent expenses are fully funded first\n",
    "- **Debt Snowball (smallest-first)**: Gives the psychological win of completely funding smaller expenses \n",
    "- **Custom priority**: Allows you to implement your own allocation logic based on personal priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how these allocation strategies work with a real-world example."
